Eg.: Merge K sorted arrays.

__Devide__ the problem into a number of subproblem that are smaller instances of the same problem.

__Conquer__ the subprblems by solving them recursively, If the subproblem sizes are small enough, however, just solve the subproblem in a straight way. Recuesive cases to buttom case;

__Combine__ the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem.
